# VMS
VIP Visitor Management System

This system is being created as part of my disseration at the University of Hull. The Plan for this system along with its requirements can
be found [here](https://github.com/mumby0168/VMS/blob/master/docs/William%20Mumby%20-%20PID.pdf)

The system uses a variety of technologies including: .NET Core, MongoDB, Redis, React, Redux, Blazor, SignalR, Electron and more.
